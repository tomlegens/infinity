Based on Foundation Framework

Currently using Foundation 6.2.1

### What is Infinity?
Infinity is a blank WordPress theme built with Foundation 6, giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch.

Infinity is a fork of the popular theme JointsWP.

### What comes with Infinity?
Infinity includes all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework. If it works in Foundation, it will work in Infinity. The theme also includes:

- Foundation Navigation Options
- Motion-UI
- Grid archive templates
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support
- Auto inclusion of SASS files in directories via sass-glob
- Add theme dependencies
- TGM plugin activation
- Related posts by tags functionality
- Much more, take a peak!

### What tools do I need to use Infinity?
You can use whatever you want. While the theme does include Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those tools. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme – Infinity won’t get in the way of your workflow.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install (Depending on your setup, Mac users may need to run sudo npm install)
- May need to run npm install gulp-sass-glob --save-dev for gulp-sass-glob. [Reference gulp-sass-glob ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass-glob)
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
- Run gulp watch to have gulp watch your css and js files for changes
