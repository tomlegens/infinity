Based on Foundation Framework

Currently using Foundation 6.2.1

### What is JointsWP?
Infinity is a blank WordPress theme built with Foundation 6, giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch.

Infinity is a fork of the popular theme JointsWP.

### What comes with Infinity?
Infinity includes all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework. If it works in Foundation, it will work in Infinity. The theme also includes:

- Foundation Navigation Options
- Motion-UI
- Grid archive templates
- Translation Support
- Bower and Gulp Support
- Auto inclusion of SASS files in directories via sass-glob

### What tools do I need to use Infinity?
You can use whatever you want – seriously. While the Sass version comes with Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those by any means. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme – Infinity won’t get in the way of your workflow.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
